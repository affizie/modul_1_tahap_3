                                        <p class="mbr-section-lead lead">This theory involves the management of projects in a non-linear way. This is in keeping with the new holistic paradigms. There are four elements for managing projects in the non-linear or chaotic framework. <br><br>Initial Area of Order <br>•	This should be as large as possible because everything will tend towards disorder. <br>•	Control by negative feedback is possible to control a small amount of disorder. <br>•	Control by positive feedback is more difficult but can be used to control a larger amount of disorder. <br><br>Learning Environment <br>•	People embrace change if they are resilient, proactive and have a positive outlook.<br>•	Results must be rewarded rather than just compliance with decisions. <br>•	Initiative and risk taking must be encouraged as success breeds success. <br>•	Professionalism must be emphasized through offering opportunities for further training. <br><br>Channels of Communication <br>•	Important due to the fluid nature of both the organizations and the projects. <br>•	Distortion should be minimized in order to avoid misunderstandings. <br>•	Access by all to new information helps determine choices available and leads to success. <br>•	Active listening by the project manager must be reinforced through such things as hot lines. <br>•	Encourage problem identification and solution at the lowest levels as it limits the size to which problems might grow and speeds up project completion.<br> <br>Evolution <br>•	Don’t end the project, allow it to continue to evolve. <br>•	Maintain continuity by keeping some portion of the development team involved on an ongoing basis in the finished project. <br>•	Administer constant change in order to avoid having to redo the entire project in order to update it in the future.&nbsp;<br></p>

They should be used to provide content expertise advice toward the development of the product. SME's have a stake in the project because it will reflect their degree of expertise and knowledge. SME’s don’t always have to be the client, but certainly are involved in providing the technical expertise to the content.<br><br>It is critical that the project manager obtains a valid representative sample of SME's to use on the project. The quality of the content will only be as good as the SME's expertise.<br><br>The Project Manager must ensure that the SME's are available, understand their role, and most importantly be left to provide Subject Matter Expertise only. A wise Project Manager will keep the SME's involved at this level only, allowing them to focus on content, rather on the development of the Multimedia Product.<br></p>

                                        <p class="mbr-section-lead lead">&nbsp;•	This is an interesting area of project management because it will often be a choice and balancing act between quality, costs, time, and resources. As alluded to earlier, the cost of developing multimedia is very expensive and can range from of $10,000 to $50,000 per hour of instruction. Labour from 50 to 100 hours per hour of instruction. All you really need to know is that producing multimedia is an expensive endevour and you really need to be prudent with your decisions. <br><br>•	In-House vs. Contracted Multimedia Development will ultimately be the Project Manager choice. If you are interested in building in-house expertise, then developing a project in-house may be the way to go. On the other hand, if you are looking for quality and cost balance, then contracting out will be an area to investigate. <br><br>•	Point to consider: Most companies and corporations contract out the multimedia development. The advantage is you can select and evaluate a production company through the competitive bidding process, select the best company to do the job, contract, and then work close and hard with then through the life of the project to maximize the potential for an excellent final product.&nbsp;<br></p>
